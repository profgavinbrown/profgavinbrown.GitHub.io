Dr Kuncheva is a Reader in the School of Informatics, University of
Bangor, and is widely recognised as a leading figure for the Multiple Classifier 
Systems community.  She is the author of over 70 publications on the 
topic including the central textbook for the field, "Combining Pattern Classifiers".<br>
<br> 
Her main contribution is seen as an extensive theoretical and empirical analysis of ensemble diversity,
in addition publishing widely in subjects varying from cluster ensembles, to the theory of majority voting, and 
most recently breaking new ground for the field in non-stationary problem domains.
