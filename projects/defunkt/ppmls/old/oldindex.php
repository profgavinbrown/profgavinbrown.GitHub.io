<font size=+1 color=blue><b>Background</b></font><bR>
<b><i>Multiple Learning Systems</b></i>, aka multiple classifier systems, ensembles, 
information fusion, have emerged as one of the strongest 
pattern recognition techniques of the last decade, influencing every area of Machine 
Learning and Data Mining. Techniques like Boosting or Bagging, that create multiple 
classifiers then combine them by voting or averaging are becoming a staple part of the ML 
toolbox. All techniques in this family rely on the 
general principle of combining information from compatible sources, 
whether they be classifiers, regressors, clusters, kernels, or distance 
measures.  Some recent work has begun to explore combining <i>procedures</i>, i.e.
complementary learning algorithms. In empirical evaluations, MLS consistently 
give outstanding performance compared to more complex state-of-the-art 
learning methods.<br>
<br>
This is the first ECML workshop to address this important principle, 
aiming to cover both the deep theoretical questions and practical applications 
of the idea.

<font size=+1 color=blue><b>Workshop Goals</b></font><bR>

The goal of this workshop is to bring together researchers that work with 
the combining principle in a very broad sense, from the <b>theory/practice of 
classifier ensembles</b> through to the integration of <b>complementary
learning methodologies.</b>
We aim to provide a platform for exchanging ideas between people
from different sub-fields of machine learning or data mining.
We expect participants that focus on various learning problems such 
as classification, clustering, regression, semi-supervised learning, 
multi-task learning, novelty detection, data organisation or 
information fusion and use either theory or efficient heuristics.
We aim to discuss the state-of-the-art techniques, ideas originating 
from various subfields of computational intelligence and to be representative
of the remaining open problems in the field.

<font size=+1 color=blue><b>Publication</b></font><bR>
The workshop proceedings will be formally published with the ECML proceedings,
and in addition distributed on a CD to all ECML participants. <b>Longer versions of
selected papers will also be considered for publication in a special
issue of the Journal of Information Fusion.</b>
