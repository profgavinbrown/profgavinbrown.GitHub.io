<font size=+1 color=blue><b>Poster Submissions</b></font><br>
A poster session will be organised as part of the workshop.  The aim of this is to 
stimulate new ideas, to present results particular suited to a visual presentation, to 
present half-baked ideas with little, none, or negative results,
or to provoke discussion.  We particularly encourage PhD candidates with posters 
outlining plans for their future research.<br>

<font size=+1 color=blue><b>Publication</b></font><bR>
Proceedings will be available both on-line and in a printed version for the 
participants. The workshop proceedings will be informally printed with the ECML proceedings,
and distributed on a CD to all ECML participants.<br><b>Extended
