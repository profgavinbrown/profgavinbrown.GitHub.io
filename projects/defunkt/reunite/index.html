REUNITE completed in September 2011.<br><br>
<hr>

The project was an EPSRC <a href="http://www.epsrc.ac.uk/funding/grants/business/schemes/Pages/knowledgetransferaccounts.aspx">KTA 
(Knowledge Transfer Account)</a> project.  The primary aim was a feasability study of utilising 
crowdsourcing and machine learning techniques to help reunite those separated 
by conflict and natural disaster.<br><br>

Imagine the following scenario. A disaster occurs in a remote part of the developing world. The local population are forced to 
flee their homes. Many are separated from their family and friends. With no mobile or Internet communication, finding loved 
ones in the aftermath of a disaster is incredibly difficult. Relief organisations go to great lengths to help people find those 
they are missing. Our system aims to make this process easier, faster and more secure.

We envisage a system were relief workers can to go into the remotest areas of the world with a video phone and securely record 
video interviews with those who have lost loved ones. These interviews are uploaded to the Reunite system where they are 
analysed by a global network of trusted individuals. Potential matches are reported back to relief workers, who can inform the 
relevant individuals and help bring them back together.<br><br>

<b>Note:</b> the scope of REUNITE as a feasability study has significantly broadened since inception.
We have identified a niche to develop Android-based mobile phone tools for the crisis-reponse community - for
example the <a href="http://vimeo.com/26618959"><b>Where's Safe?</b></a> application.
