<b>ADEPT</b> is an EPSRC sponsored project between the 
Universities of 
Manchester and Bristol.<br><br> 
 
<b>ADEPT</b> (Adaptive Dynamic Ensemble Prediction 
Techniques) aims to capitalize on the synergistic interface between three fields: 
evolutionary computation, ensemble learning, and probabilistic modeling.
The project's primary goal is to take a heuristic technique from 
the Evolutionary Computation literature - Learning Classifier 
Systems - and translate it into an ensemble-based probabilistic model.
The probabilistic model we have devloped can precisely reproduce the capabilities of the LCS - an online 
supervised learning 
system, continuously adaptive, maintaining a parsimonious set of human-interpretable rules.  However, the new 
model stands apart from 
the parameter-laden heuristic nature of LCS, having the advantages of a statistical underpinning: 
flexibility and a solid 
probabilistic foundation.<br><br> 
 
In the course of understanding how to construct this model, we have also contributed significantly to
the understanding of ensemble diversity in nonstationary learning, and information theoretic feature 
selection 
methodologies.<br><br>
