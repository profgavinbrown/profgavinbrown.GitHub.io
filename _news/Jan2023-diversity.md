text: 'New preprint out, <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.03962">A Unified Theory of Diversity in Ensemble Learning</a>.  This is the result of a long chain of research, beginning right back with my PhD. It formulates a theory that explains the nature and role of diversity in several supervised learning scenarios. Thankyou EPSRC for supporting this!'
