"The study of ensemble methods, with model outputs
considered for their abstract properties rather than
the specifics of the algorithm which produced them,
allows for a wide impact across many fields of study.
If we can understand precisely <i>why</i>, <i>when</i>, and <i>how</i> particular
ensemble methods can be applied successfully,
we would have made progress toward a powerful new
tool for Machine Learning: <i>the ability to automatically
exploit the strengths and weaknesses of different learning
systems.</i>"</blockquote>

<b>New Grant (9th Sept 2010)</b> - EPSRC KTA, Reuniting Refugees with Computational Intelligence.<br>
<b><a href="http://mlo.cs.manchester.ac.uk/reunite">REUNITE</a></b> is a research project aiming to utilise 
crowdsourcing and machine 
learning 
techniques to help reunite those separated by conflict and natural disaster.
Imagine the following scenario. A disaster occurs in a remote part of the developing world. The local 
population are forced to flee their homes. Many are separated from their family and friends. With no 
mobile or Internet communication, finding loved ones in the aftermath of a disaster is incredibly 
difficult. Relief organisations go to great lengths to help people find those they are missing. The 
system we are developing aims to make this process easier, faster and more secure.<br>

<b>AISTATS 2009 paper - Feature Selection with Information Theory</b><br>
The traditional approach to so-called <i>filter methods</i> in feature selection is to construct
a criterion to measure the utility of any given feature.  The more sophisticated methods <i>penalize</i>
feature-feature correlations (`redundancy') with various penalty terms.  The last 15 years have produced a flood
of papers advocating different penalty terms.  My recent work shows that the vast majority of these can be naturally
<i>derived</i> from a single framework, using multivariate information theory.  <i>The work reveals 
that there exists a natural, smooth space space of feature selection criteria, where each paper over 
the last 15 years corresponds to one point.</i> Most of the 
space has never been explored. See the <a

for details.<br><br>

<b>Invited plenary at UK-KDD 2009 - Feature Selection by Filters, a Unifying Perspective</b><br>

<b>New Grant - Dynamic Ensemble Techniques (EPSRC grant EP/F023855/1</b>)<br>
With colleagues at Bristol, I am investigating how dynamic ensemble techniques can 
tackle multi-step (control) and 
nonstationary problems. This is in collaboration with <a href=http://www.cs.bris.ac.uk/~kovacs>Tim Kovacs</a>,
<a href=http://www.cs.bris.ac.uk/~marshall>James Marshall</a> and
<a href=http://www.cs.bham.ac.uk/~jlw>Jeremy Wyatt</a>, 
conducted under our EPSRC funded <b>ADEPT</b> project</a>.<br><br>

<b>New Grant - Machine Learning for Multi-Core Computers (EPSRC grant EP/G000662/1</b>)<br>
The computer industry is undergoing the "multi-core" revolution.  When you buy a PC off the shelf
these days, it is inevitably "dual-core" or "quad-core".  This idea of more and more
CPU "cores" executing in parallel is expected to continue to the hundreds and thousands.  The problem of
<i>coordinating</i> these cores is challenging and <i>unsolved</i>.  With <a 
href="http://www.cs.manchester.ac.uk/apt/people/mlujan/">Mikel Lujan</a> and 
<a href="http://www.cs.man.ac.uk/~jsinger">Jeremy Singer</a>  I am working on applying Machine Learning to this
problem, conducted under our EPSRC funded <b>iTLS</b> project.<br>

<b>IEEE TNN paper on Sparse Distributed Memories</b><br>
In a project with <a href="http://www.cs.manchester.ac.uk/apt/people/sfurber">Steve 
Furber</a> I found that sparse distributed memory models like the correlation matrix memories of Wilshaw and Kanerva could give 
significant  insights into the design of fault tolerant computer architectures. This resulted in a IEEE TNN paper

<br>

<b>Ensemble Learning</b><br>
I worked for a long while on the issue of <i>diversity</i> in ensembles, with <a 
href="http://www.cs.bham.ac.uk/~jlw">Jeremy Wyatt</a>. A summary of the work can be found on
<a href=projects/nc>this page.</a>  A slightly less optimistic (but rather 
insightful) take on the field is found <a href=http://www.cs.man.ac.uk/~gbrown/dilbert.gif>here</a>.<br>

<b>Image Feature Extraction</b><br>
I did a nice project with Honda several years ago, which turned into a <a

on <i><b>image feature extraction</b></i> - I follow
up little avenues on this occasionally.  Throughout this time I have maintained an interest in
<b><i>evolutionary speciation and optimisation</i></b>, which has spun off into several useful
collaborations.<br><br>
