I am Professor of Machine Learning, in the Department of Computer Science.


What do I do?
======
I work on theoretical and methodological aspects of Machine Learning.
I have contributed to the understanding of "feature selection" algorithms, with particularly nice results on information theoretic methods, and on the stability of algorithms.
I have also contributed to the area of "ensemble" learning methods, in particular the study of diversity, and cost-sensitivity.
I have applied these ideas in, e.g. bioinformatics, clinical trial data, and data from predictive policing.
