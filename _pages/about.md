I am Professor of Machine Learning in the Department of Computer Science, at The University of Manchester.


What do I do?
======
My research interests have varied over the years.  I have contributed mainly to the understanding of
feature selection/extraction with information theoretic methods, and to the theory and practice of ensemble learning methods.

Primarily I work on the theory behind these algorithms, and methodological improvements.
However I have applied work in  e.g. analytics on data from clinical trials, and from predictive policing.
