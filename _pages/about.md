I am Professor of Machine Learning, in the Department of Computer Science, at The University of Manchester.


What do I do?
======
I work on theoretical and methodological aspects of statistical Machine Learning.  I have contributed to the understanding of feature selection, with particular focus on information theoretic methods, and to ensemble learning methods, in particular the study of diversity. I have also applied work, e.g. bioinformatics, clinical trial data, and data from predictive policing.
