I've been at Manchester since 2004 and have held a variety of roles.

The main ones have been Director of Research, and Director of Undergraduate Recruitment.
I've taught the modules for both UG and MSc introduction to Machine Learning.
Some of the <a href="http://syllabus.cs.manchester.ac.uk/pgt/2019/COMP61011/">materials are still available</a>,
including <a href="/files/NotVeryScaryBook2018.pdf">a book I wrote, on the basics of ML</a>.<br><br>

I've also taught invited sessions at various Summer Schools,
on Ensemble Methods and Advanced Feature Selection Methods.
Just ask me for the materials if you would like them.<br><br>



<b>In October 2022, I'll be teaching new modules</b>.<br>

<ul>
  <li>COMP81020: <i>Starting your Postgraduate Research.</i>
  <li>COMP83020: <i>Preparing for your Final PhD year.</i>
  <li>COMP34312: <i>Mathematical Topics in Machine Learning.</i>
</ul>

This page will contain details, as soon as possible....
